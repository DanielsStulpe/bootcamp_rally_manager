# Bootcamp Rally Racing Manager

This project was developed as part of an **assessment in the Data Engineering Bootcamp**. It demonstrates how to combine **Snowflake** and **Streamlit** to build an interactive racing team manager and race simulation app.

---

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **`snf_script.sql`** ‚Äì SQL script to create the required Snowflake schema, tables, and initial data setup.
- **`app.py`** ‚Äì Main Streamlit application that connects to Snowflake via Snowpark and provides the interactive UI.
- **`requirements.txt`** ‚Äì List of Python dependencies to install for running the app.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DanielsStulpe/bootcamp_rally_manager
cd bootcamp_rally_manager
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
# Activate it
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a **.env** file in the project root with your Snowflake credentials:
```env
SNOWFLAKE_USER=your_username
SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=your_password
SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=your_account_identifier
SNOWFLAKE_ROLE=your_role
SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE=your_warehouse
SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE=your_database
SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA=your_schema
```

### 5. Setup Snowflake Schema
Run the `snf_script.sql` in your Snowflake environment to create required tables and schema.

### 6. Run the App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
